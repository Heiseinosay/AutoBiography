            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>1</sup> was given a not so complicated
            name Jeleazar. <sup>2</sup> I was born on July 29, 2002, in the
            charming town of Cabanatuan. <sup>3</sup> My parents worked so hard
            to support our family. <sup>4</sup> I have 3 siblings, two
            oldersisters and a younger brother. <sup>5</sup> We were raised in a
            loving and supportive home. <sup>6</sup> I grew up in a very
            religious household where we attended church every Sunday morning.
            <sup>7</sup> My parents raised us with high morals and values from
            an early age. <sup>8</sup> I had a strong interest in basketball and
            played on the squad with my friends. <sup>9</sup> I also enjoyed
            traveling to see my distant grandparents, who lived in Bulacan.
          </p>

      <p>
        <sup>10</sup> The people who have supported me the most and have always
        told me to follow my aspirations are my grandparents.<sup>11</sup>
        Video games have been a part of my life since I was a young child.
        <sup>12</sup> My parents bought our first console, the play station 2,
        it is a gift for my birthday. <sup>13</sup> We would spend hours playing
        games like “Space Invaders” and “Asteroids”. <sup>14</sup> As I got
        older, my tastes in video games changed to more mature titles such as
        “Grand Theft Auto” and “Red Dead Redemption”. <sup>15</sup> Video games
        have always been an escape for me from reality and they still are
        today.<sup>16</sup> My early years were full of joy, love, and special
        occasions. <sup>17</sup> I had the good fortune to grow up in a loving
        family and close-knit community. <sup>18</sup> I attended elementary
        school in Cabanatuan and did well academically. <sup>19</sup> Overall, I
        had a really happy childhood, and I'm grateful for the events that
        helped me become the person I am now. <sup>20</sup> I it is no wonder
        that I miss those days.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>1</sup> I should start by saying that as I
            get older and grow older, my body is changing.<sup>2</sup> It is
            mostly for us that the change of preference and consciousness on our
            looks started in our teenage.<sup>3</sup> As a teenager, I continued
            to focus on my education and not quite excelled but I did well in my
            studies.<sup>4</sup> My high school classmates are always competing
            with one another, so I have started to develop a motto of my
            own.<sup>5</sup> One shouldn't put too much pressure on themselves
            to perform well in their exams because, in the end, grades don't
            matter;<sup>6</sup> what matters is the level of information one
            has.<sup>7</sup> Therefore, put more emphasis on learning than on
            grades.<sup>2</sup> Still, learnings and discipline reflect
            grades.<sup>8</sup> I discovered a passion for programming and spent
            countless hours learning new skills and building projects.<sup
              >9</sup
            >
            My parents supported my interests and encouraged me to pursue my
            passions.

        <sup>10</sup> I started to develop a sense of independence and
        responsibility, taking on part-time jobs to save money for college.<sup
          >11</sup
        >
        I had my first serious relationship during this time, learning about
        love and heartbreak.<sup>12</sup> I struggled with self-doubt and
        insecurity at times but had a strong support system of family and
        friends to help me through.<sup>13</sup> I started to consider my future
        plans and career goals, researching universities and exploring potential
        majors. Of course, I lived my teenage life with fulfillment.
        <sup>14</sup> While enjoying myself I did not forget how to act in
        accord with what my parents taught me.<sup>15</sup> I had a close group
        of friends who I spent most of my time with, and we would often have
        sleepovers and play video games together.<sup>16</sup> My family was
        very close and we would have big gatherings with extended family on
        holidays and special occasions. <sup>17</sup> There are things that I
        missed in my teenage time. <sup>18</sup> In my teenage years, I had
        boundaries that I didn't cross.<sup>19</sup> I still assume that there
        are missed opportunities to live and act like one.<sup>20</sup> Careless
        but not immoral, I supposed as of now I can't act rashly like
        before.<sup>21</sup> Overall, my childhood was filled with love,
        laughter, and adventure, and I am grateful for the experiences and
        memories I made.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>1</sup> The college experience often
            involves balancing academics, social life, and personal
            responsibilities. <sup>2</sup> My college years were some of the
            most formative and exciting times of my life.<sup>3</sup> I attended
            AMA Cabanatuan Campus, where I pursued a degree in Computer
            Science.<sup>4</sup> During my time at the university, I was able to
            develop discipline in studying on my own, making new discoveries,
            and forming new skills over time.<sup>5</sup> The pandemic pushes us
            in ways that we are not familiar with. <sup>6</sup> Over the last
            few years, people are adapting to new terms and societal approaches.
            <sup>7</sup> The education system proposed a method of distance
            learning so students can be able to continue studying in the middle
            of the pandemic. <sup>8</sup> The first year of college wasn't so
            welcoming at all. The fact that I cannot meet or even recognize the
            names and faces of my classmates is indeed a source of sheer misery.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        <sup>9</sup> Speaking candidly, there are moments when I feel as though
        I cannot become a professional after pursuing the use of such a novel
        educational system because it doesn't genuinely feel like I'm in
        college. <sup>10</sup> Poor execution of the school system provided me
        with a responsibility to discipline myself. <sup>11</sup> With that in
        mind, I made the decision to step up my game and enroll in a more
        prestigious university in the hopes that they could help me train and
        develop my skills to become a professional. <sup>12</sup> I transferred
        to a university called The University of the East. It was a fresh start,
        knowing and experiencing a good sudden change of environment.
        <sup>13</sup> With knowledge of and exposure to a positive abrupt
        environmental change, it was a new beginning. <sup>14</sup> As of now,
        we are having a combination of a face to face and online learning.
        <sup>15</sup> I'm trying to be the version of myself by gradually
        practicing good habits that surely help me to enhance my skills and
        knowledge. <sup>16</sup> At the moment, I am learning the ways of living
        by myself. <sup>17</sup> I'm currently learning how to live
        independently. <sup>18</sup> College is fun, with classmates and friends
        until you experience having a tres, gosh it gives me mental stress then
        your going to be depressed. <sup>19</sup> I'm currently modifying and
        honing strategies to deal with school difficulties. <sup>20</sup> I am
        hoping or rather I say planning to walk on a bright path ahead.
